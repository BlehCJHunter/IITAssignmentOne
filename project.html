		The SUPER AWESOME cat food opener
	</h1>
	<h2 style="text-align: center;">
		Foreword: This was not actually inspired by the example, I just thought of how much I hated feeding my two 
cats their wet food and realised I could use it as an idea for my assignment.
	</h2>
	<h3>
		Overview
	</h3>
	<p>
		This project will be about an Arduino solution to hands-free cat food serving, using code, electronics and 
mechanics to ensure that there is no chance of the human feeding the cat(s) touching the cat food, and thus needing to wash 
their hands if they are like me and stupid about stuff like that. Though the intent is to prevent the accidental touching of 
cat food, it will also provide convenience, as it will somewhat automate feeding your cats.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Motivation
	</h3>
	<p>
		There is at least one other person like me who absolutely abhors meat/unwanted/slimy stuff touching them, so 
this may serve to provide a bit of relief for people such as me when it comes time to feed their cats. Arduinos are fairly 
cheap, while remaining powerful when it comes to pinouts and digital/analog signaling, and so it would make the perfect 
platform to delevop and use for the process. The much larger market of people who do not care about silly things like 
"touching cat food," but also own cats, can also find use for this as it makes an aspect of their life easier due to 
automation.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Description
	</h3>
	<p>
		Using the best in 3D-printed parts and stock electronic components, this device will perform every 
necessary step in opening your cats wet food, be it in the horrid satchel or the equally horrid can. For the satchel form 
factor, it will remove the top with a built-in slicer, and scrape out every last dripping morsel for your cats to enjoy, 
without you needing to spend 10 minutes fiddling with the satchel to try and get the wet food out without touching it. For 
the tins of wet cat food, it will use a special lever apparatus to open the tin, then invert it and scrape out the food to 
ensure that none is left in the tin whatsoever. It will also have a cat biscuit storage compartment, and can be made to 
dispense a controlled amount of cat biscuits at the push of a button. Even if you do not care about touching cat food, you 
can find use for this as a quick and easy method of feeding your cats. Just insert the food packet, hit the button for the 
correct form factor, and wait as it opens the food and pours it onto a plate for your cats to enjoy.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Tools and Tech required
	</h3>
	<p>
		The machine will require an Arduino to operate, and the Arduino will require software capable of programming 
it in a manner where everything compiles and the Arduino doesn't damage itself or the other components. The machine will 
require DC motors, knife blades, standard electrical components and plastic, printed from a 3D printer. The 3D printer will 
require software capable of running it, and CAD software to design a shell and mechanical components that can grab, 
manipulate, pour and scrape all of the cat food out of the container.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Skills required
	</h3>
	<p>
		Knowledge of coding for Arduino will be required, along with knowledge of CAD software and good design 
sensibilities. The software that the Arduino will run will need to be hand-coded, and the routines manually timed such that 
they are capable of running in a timely fasion without damaging or spilling the cat food. Arduino tends to be fairly common, 
and CAD design, along with 3D printing, are becoming commonplace and are often workplace skills, and so should not be that 
hard to find. The overall feasability of finding everything/everyone required is fairly high.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Outcome
	</h3>
	<p>
		If the project is successful, the outcome will be a few people who have irrational tendancies, like me, will 
feel a bit better when feeding their pet cats. The original problem, touching disgusting wet cat food, will be solved by 
this by allowing people to not need to touch an open packet of their cats food to feed their cats, and will also vastly 
improve the opening of satchel-based foods, that require an odd pattern of shaking, squishing, opening, and then more 
squishing to get a decent amount of the food out. This development will have little impact, though it will probably be used 
by more than just the intended audience due to the convenience factor that it provides on top of the preventation of 
disgust.
