			My interest in IT
		</h3>
		<p>
			My interest in IT came when my uncle gave me a desktop in 2008, though it was mostly the same as 
other kids my age (play games, nothing more). It eventually died down when I got into 
reading, and remained basically non-existant until my grandparents got me a laptop for christmas in 2011, and I returned to 
playing games. This continued until the laptop got really slow, around 
2013-14, and I decided to install linux, reasoning being "It can't get any worse". Troubleshooting Ubuntu and making 
everything continue working was what really sparked my interest, especially 
because the damage that the laptop had sustained in a car-on-tree collision a year or two prior meant that its cooling was 
not working, and Windows was too demanding for the laptop to run without 
overheating, meaning the only way I could use it was with Linux. Since then, some form of Linux has been a staple on my 
computers, and I have learnt to code in Java, JavaScript, bash and a small 
amount of HTML and CSS.
