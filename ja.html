	<h3>
		Description of the job
	</h3>
	<p>
		The job is to do with systems administration, technical support and network optimisation. The position is 
appealing to me as I like helping people, and technical support and optimising networks both accomplish that goal. I am also 
fond of high-level work, and attempting to ensure that a system remains operation.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Requirements
	</h3>
	<p>
		The job advises having a minimum of 3 to 5 years working with IT, or having a degree in IT. The job also 
necessitates good problem solving skills, knowledge of specific Cisco network hardware, a driver's licence valid in QLD, 
knowledge of VMWare and VMWare related tools and knowledge of enterprise technology systems. The job also requires good 
social skills, ability to work to deadlines, work ethic and cultural sensitivity.
	</p>
	<h3>
		My Current Skills
	</h3>
	<p>
		I have skills with working with computers, I have a decent problem solving ability, 10 days of work 
experience as an IT contractor and the ability to barely meet deadlines.
	</p>
	<h3>
		My Plan
	</h3>
	<p>
		I plan to get the required qualifications through courses in RMIT and hands-on experience. Tinkering with 
software such as VMWare is simple enough for me to accomplish, though I may miss stuff in my tinkering. RMIT should offer 
courses that touch on most if not all of the requirements like hardware knowledge, networking, and the soft skills will be 
picked up as I learn and interact with people.
