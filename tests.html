	<h3>
		Meyers-Briggs Personality Types
	</h3>
	<p>
		As a foreword, in 2012, this test scored me as INTP, in 2016, this test scored me as INTJ, and now, the 
result is<br><img src="https://puu.sh/DGhPK/7ff8df8ed9.png" alt="ISTP" width="600" height="600">

	<h3>
		Learning Style Test
	</h3>
	<p>
		Auditory/Tactile. <a

results are here</a>

	<h3>
		Test of my choosing
	</h3>
	<p>
		I chose an IPIP Big Five test. <a 
href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=1.3,3.5,2.78,2.5,3.8#_V">Exact results are here</a>, or 
a screencap is available:<br><img src="https://puu.sh/DGi8J/1cb3b2babe.png">

	<h3>
		What it all means to me
	</h3>
	<p>
		Now, other than my inability to derive meaning from any of these results, these results mean that I am 
me.<br>Jokes aside, these results imply I am decent when it comes to mechanical and technical skill/knowledge, but have 
difficulties with super-abstract concepts. The results themselves will probably not influence my behaviour in a team, as I 
will probably forget them at some point in the near future, but if I were to remember them, I should take into account that 
I am (according to the Meyers-Briggs test) very prone to getting side-tracked, and will need someone able to work me getting 
side-tracked into making the work that is required.
